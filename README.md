## Hi there 👋 I'm Anuoluwapo Kuye || Geospatial Analyst || Spatial Designer

- 🌍 Based in Nigeria || 🏆 Winner, FIG VCSP Hackathon (2025)
- 🔭 What I Do

  I explore the world through maps, patterns, and stories waiting to be uncovered. I’m a Geospatial Analyst and Designer with hands-on experience in GIS, remote sensing, and programming, transforming complex spatial data into insights that are visually compelling, understandable, and actionable. I tackle climate and environmental challenges with projects spanning agricultural drought monitoring, flood mapping, land-use analysis, and community-based environmental assessments, using GIS platforms, remote sensing datasets, and scripting environments to analyze patterns and communicate results through thoughtful design and visualization for both technical and non-technical audiences.

- I am always open to collaboration, research exchange, or new ideas.
Feel free to connect!
